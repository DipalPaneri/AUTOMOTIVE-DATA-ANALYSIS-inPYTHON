# DATA-ANALYSIS-WITH-PYTHON
Data Analysis Process with Python Anaconda Environment using the libraries Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib Pyplot and Tickers and Seaborn. 

Objective: Utilize Python for data analysis to extract insights from automotive sales data.
Data Collection: Gather automotive sales data from diverse sources such as Kaggle datasets or industry-specific databases.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Employ data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform EDA, visualize trends, and identify patterns in the data.
Insights Generation: Analyze automotive sales trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics to derive actionable insights.
Reporting and Recommendations: Summarize findings through clear visualizations and provide strategic recommendations to improve sales performance and marketing strategies.

"In this project, we utilized Python for data analysis to extract valuable insights from automotive sales data. We collected the data from various sources, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. After preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Through EDA, we identified trends in automotive sales, customer preferences, and market dynamics. Finally, we summarized our findings and provided actionable recommendations to improve sales performance and marketing strategies in the automotive industry."
